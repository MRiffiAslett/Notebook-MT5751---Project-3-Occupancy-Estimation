### Abstract

This study examines the occupancy patterns of the willow tit (*Poecile montanus*) in Switzerland, based on the Swiss Breeding Bird Survey. We explore the impact of elevation, forest cover, and survey characteristics on the species' presence and detectability. The study provides critical insights for wildlife management, emphasizing forested habitats, especially at higher elevations, for the conservation of willow tit populations.

## Introduction

The willow tit, a key species in temperate and boreal forests, faces challenges like habitat loss and environmental changes. Our study aims to understand its occupancy patterns in Switzerland, contributing to effective conservation strategies.

---

## Methodology

Using data from the Swiss Breeding Bird Survey, we employ occupancy modeling to assess species distribution and abundance. The study incorporates elevation, forest cover, and survey characteristics in the analysis.

---

## Results

Our findings reveal a significant positive relationship between forest cover and occupancy probability. The interaction between elevation and forest cover indicates higher occupancy in forested areas at elevated locations.

---

## Discussion

The study discusses the detection consistency of willow tits and considers factors like survey timing and spatial autocorrelation. The findings highlight the importance of comprehensive sampling for robust ecological conclusions.

### Key Highlights

- Significant interaction between elevation and forest cover.
- Importance of forested habitats at higher elevations.
- Critical insights for targeted conservation efforts.
